# Piglet

Piglet is an **Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS)** inspired by [Zhepeng's Pigasus](https://github.com/crossroadsfpga/pigasus). The goal of this project is to demonstrate usecase of [Xilinx Network P4](https://www.xilinx.com/products/intellectual-property/ef-di-vitisnetp4.html) on NIPS built on FPGA-first architecture. For more information about FPGA-first architecture, see [Zhipeng's Paper](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi20/presentation/zhao-zhipeng).
